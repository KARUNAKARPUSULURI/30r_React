React -> library
Angular ->  Framework
Vue -> framework

Must know concepts or topics -> 
1. Library vs Framework

library :- set of functions -> calendar -> light weight
framework :- set of functions(libraries) + structure -> form, table, button,  -> heavy loading
2. Node js (basic installation and setup)
//backend -> run time envirnment means that you can run your js code outside the browser ->
-> Open google -> node js install -> Enter -> Loading...(false) && nodejs.org -> download NODE.JS -> select version ->alweays pefer LTS(long term support) version -> copy to clipboard -> then paste in your powershell 
3. NPM &N NVM
