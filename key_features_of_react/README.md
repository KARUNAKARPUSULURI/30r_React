# Project Overview

This project is built using React and showcases a component-based architecture. Below is a detailed explanation of the project structure and key features.

## Project Structure

### 1. Node Modules
The `node_modules` folder contains all third-party libraries and dependencies required for the project. These libraries are installed via npm and are essential for the application's functionality.

**Note:** You have modify access to this folder, but it is recommended not to make changes directly, as it may lead to unexpected behavior.

### 2. Public
The `public` folder serves as a static directory where you can store images and other assets that need to be accessible throughout the project. Files in this folder can be referenced directly in your application.

### 3. Source (src)
The `src` folder is the main source directory for your application code. It contains all the components, styles, and logic that make up the application.

#### Babel
Babel is a JavaScript transpiler that converts modern JavaScript code into a version that is compatible with older browsers. It allows developers to use the latest JavaScript features without worrying about browser support.

### Key Features of React

React is known for its component-based architecture, which allows for reusable and maintainable code. The key types of components in React are:

1. **Functional Components**
   - These are JavaScript functions that return JSX. They are simpler and easier to read, making them a popular choice for many developers.

2. **Class-Based Components**
   - These components are ES6 classes that extend from `React.Component`. They can hold and manage their own state and lifecycle methods.

## Key Libraries Used
- **Lodash:** A utility library that provides helpful functions for manipulating arrays, objects, and other data types.
- **jQuery:** A fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library that simplifies HTML document traversal and manipulation.
- **Chalk:** A library for styling terminal strings with colors.
- **Chart.js:** A library for creating beautiful charts and graphs.
- **D3.js:** A JavaScript library for producing dynamic, interactive data visualizations in web browsers.
- **Moment.js:** A library for parsing, validating, manipulating, and formatting dates.
- **Bootstrap:** A popular CSS framework for developing responsive and mobile-first websites.
- **Material UI:** A React component library that implements Google's Material Design.
- **Ant Design (antd):** A design system with a set of high-quality React components.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for creating custom designs.
